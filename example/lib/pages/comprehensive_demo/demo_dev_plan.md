# Comprehensive Table Demo Development Plan

## Overview
A single integrated demo that showcases key Flutter Table Plus features in a progressive manner. This replaces multiple scattered examples with one comprehensive demonstration.

## Philosophy
- **Progressive Implementation**: Each phase builds upon previous phases
- **Single Source of Truth**: All features demonstrated in one place

- Action buttons (edit, delete, view details, etc.)
- Configurable button position (left, right, center)
- Themed hover button styling
- Integration with existing hover button system

### ðŸ”„ Phase 7: Custom Cells and Themes
**Status**: Pending
**Goal**: Advanced cell rendering and comprehensive theming

## Data Structure

### Employee Model
```dart
class DemoEmployee {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String position;
  final String department;
  final double salary;
  final String avatar;
  final double performance; // 0.0 to 1.0
  final List<String> skills;
  final DateTime joinDate;
  final String email;
  final String phone;
}
```

### Department Model  
```dart
class DemoDepartment {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String manager;
  final int memberCount;
  final double budget;
  final List<String> projects;
  final Color color;
  final String description;
  final String location;
}
```

## Key Design Decisions

### âœ… No External Dependencies
- Custom formatters instead of intl package
- Self-contained solution for maximum compatibility

### âœ… Realistic Data
- 10 employees across 5 departments
- Real-world data types and relationships
- Meaningful business context

### âœ… Progressive Complexity
- Each phase builds on previous functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Maintainable code structure

### âœ… Educational Focus
- Clear visual indicators of phase completion
- Debug logging for development insights
- Comprehensive feature demonstrations

## Removed Features
- **Frozen Columns**: Removed due to bugs and poor user experience
- Focus on core features that provide better stability and usability

## Testing Strategy
- Manual testing for each phase completion
- Visual verification of all implemented features
- Cross-platform compatibility testing
- Performance testing with larger datasets (future)

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with state management solutions (Riverpod examples)
- Internationalization support
- Accessibility improvements
- Performance optimizations for large datasets
- Additional export formats
